  Welcome!
  I'm Irah Nii-Kwame Oteng-Quarshie, a Computer Engineering graduate from California State University, Fullerton. I currently work as a Software & Controls Engineer at Sorenson Engineering, where I combine my passion for automation, control systems, and PLC programming to drive innovation on the manufacturing floor.

  With a strong foundation in hardware, firmware, and embedded systems, I am motivated by hands-on problem solving and pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. I am actively seeking opportunities in controls/automation engineering, PLC programming, and embedded systems developmentâ€”fields where I can continue creating efficient, forward-thinking solutions.
